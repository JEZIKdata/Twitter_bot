Did you know that almost **66 percent** of all tweets containing links are tweeted or retweeted by bots? It is very likely that you’ve interacted with a bot without even knowing it! Twitter is one of the most **bot-friendly** environments out there so why not build one ourselves.
Let’s make our lives a little bit easier with replying to **birthday wishes** on Twitter what can be very tedious sometimes. We are going to build an **autoreplying bot to birthday wishes** where we were tagged and that contains hashtag #happybirthday. For our project we are going to use **Tweepy library**, which is an open/source, easy to use Python library for accessing the Twitter API.

1.	First thing we need to do is to apply for access on **Twitter Developer account** on https://developer.twitter.com. 
2.	In App details we are going to generate Twitter app’s **API keys and access tokens**.
3.	After creating our app, important thing is to change settings by clicking at Add permissions from the default read only to **read and write**, which allows our bot to autoreply on tweets. 
4.	We will be deploying our birthday bot on **PythonAnywhere** which is a clould-based hosting provider where you can deploy your Python projects for free.
